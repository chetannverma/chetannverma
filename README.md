## 🌌 Who I Am  
A builder wandering the quiet space between **data, intelligence, and security**.  
A thinker who enjoys **clean logic**, **honest numbers**, and **systems that behave at 3 AM**.

I navigate the overlapping worlds of:

- ⚔️ **SOC Operations** — finding patterns in digital noise  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning (IIT Mandi)** — models, math, meaning  
- 🔧 **Backend Engineering** — APIs, automation, micro-services  
- 📊 **Data Analytics** — dashboards that tell the truth  

I like problems that fight back.  
I prefer solutions that feel elegant.
